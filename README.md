# unit-4-game

I thought I had the reset issue resloved but I tried for hours to get it to work. This is something I need to get help with as I believe it is the only piece of code that prevented me from completing this project.

Generating the random numbers works everytime I just need to refresh the browser in order to obtain a new set of random numbers. My scores add up nicely and when I either pass or match the random number I get the alert indicating a win or loss and my win or loss counter will go up accordingly.
